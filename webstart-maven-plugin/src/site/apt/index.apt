Webstart Maven Plugin

  The Webstart Plugin generates application bundles that can be deployed via Web Start.
  The plugin can be used to prepare standalone webstart applications or webstart apps bundled in WAR
  files (with or without Sun's Download Servlet).
  It handles the generation of JNLP files and optional <<<version.xml>>> files, using Velocity templates.
  It also handles the selection and preparation of the dependencies, performing signing, unsigning and Pack200
  compression when required.

  Although not yet at version 1.0, the plugin is approaching maturity and can be used in a production environment.

  It requires Maven 2 (version 2.0.6 or later) to work correctly.
